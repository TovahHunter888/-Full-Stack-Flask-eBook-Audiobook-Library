# -Full-Stack-Flask-eBook-Audiobook-Library
The Reading Nookie is a full-stack web application built as a final project to demonstrate real-world skills in web development, database design, and application planning. Developed using Flask, MySQL, MySQL Workbench, HTML/CSS, and Jinja2, the app allows users to browse a curated library of downloadable eBooks and audio content.

This project highlights the integration of a MySQL relational database with a Flask-based backend, structured query handling, and dynamic content rendering via Jinja templates. MySQL Workbench was used to model, create, and manage the database schema, including foreign key relationships between users, books, and reviews.
